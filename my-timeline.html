        This invasion was an attempt to take over the throne which was under King Edward and his successor Harold Godwinson. 
        William I, the Duke of Normandy and soon-to-be Conqueror, challenged candidates Harald III of Norway and Godwinson's brother Tostig by invading south England. 
        Through a series of battles, deadly military tactics, and threats from rebels, William I claimed victory [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        After the victory, William I established the ideas that would form feudalism, a prevailing form of government based on full ownership of land by a Lord (one of higher power). William assigned people as landowners, and landowners had a mutual obligation to provide military services.
        This system of government made legislation and social justice directly tied to a monarch, who was in charge of all lawmaking, implementation and interpretation of law.

        One of the first legal documents that recognize the Indigenous peoples and their title to land rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        The formation of the treaty occurred after the end of the Seven Years War (1756 - 1763), where Great Britain claimed victory over France, 
        and was now ruling over land that would form both Canada and the United States. It allowed legislative authority to be held under three parties: the governor, the governor's council, and the assembly. Although this came before the establishment of Canada as a country, 
        this treaty was responsible for the institutional relationship between the government and aboriginal groups that is still in effect today.

        Enacted by the British Parliament, this served to preserve the French Canadian population and revoke the assimilation attempts caused by the Royal Proclamation Treaty [3]. This event is seen as an act 
        of gaining the trust of French-spoken people and establish rights to property and religious freedom in Quebec. However, this was to the dismay of the American colonies, serving an important catalyst to the American Revolutionary War [3]. This event can be seen as one of the earliest forms of English-French peace relations in Canada, 
        and would influence many legislative decisions made in Quebec to preserve human rights and culture.

        A significant event of the American Revolution (1765 - 1791), this war contributed to the political independence of North American colonies that were held under Great Britain. The effects of the war were of great magnitude, 
      	resulting in establishment of the American Declaration of Independence, and a large amount of unfavorable settlers emigrating towards Canadian territory [5].
