        This invasion was an attempt to take over the throne which was under King Edward and his successor Harold Godwinson. 
        William I, the Duke of Normandy and soon-to-be Conqueror, challenged candidates Harald III of Norway and Godwinson's brother Tostig by invading south England. 
        Through a series of battles, deadly military tactics, and threats from rebels, William I claimed victory [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        After the victory, William I established the ideas that would form feudalism, a prevailing form of government based on full ownership of land by a Lord (one of higher power). William assigned people as landowners, and landowners had a mutual obligation to provide military services.
        This system of government made legislation and social justice directly tied to a monarch, who was in charge of all lawmaking, implementation and interpretation of law.

      </p>
      <p>
        The formation of the treaty occurred after the end of the Seven Years War (1756 - 1763), where Great Britain claimed victory over France, 
        and was now ruling over land that would form both Canada and the United States. It allowed legislative authority to be held under three parties: the governor, the governor's council, and the assembly. Although this came before the establishment of Canada as a country, 
        this treaty was responsible for the institutional relationship between the government and aboriginal groups that is still in effect today.

        Enacted by the British Parliament, this served to preserve the French Canadian population and revoke the assimilation attempts caused by the Royal Proclamation Treaty [3]. This event is seen as an act 
        of gaining the trust of French-spoken people and establish rights to property and religious freedom in Quebec. However, this was to the dismay of the American colonies, serving an important catalyst to the American Revolutionary War [3]. This event can be seen as one of the earliest forms of English-French peace relations in Canada, 
        and would influence many legislative decisions made in Quebec to preserve human rights and culture.

        A significant event of the American Revolution (1765 - 1791), this war contributed to the political independence of North American colonies that were held under Great Britain. The effects of the war were of great magnitude, 
      	resulting in establishment of the American Declaration of Independence, and a large amount of unfavorable settlers emigrating towards Canadian territory [5]. Those who emigrated were seen as British loyalists, and thus developed 
        a culture shaped around conservatism. This can be seen as the birth of Canadian culture, and an example of influence from Britain's parliamentary government that would form the nation to come.

        Synonymously known as the Canada Act of 1791, this was enacted by the Parliament of Britain to segregate the province of Quebec into two regions: Upper and Lower Canada. Key justifications of this act included access to equal rights, woman's right to vote, 
        and establishment of provincial legislation [10]. Upper Canada mainly used Common law, whereas Lower Canada used Old french law [10]. 
        This act, along with the Quebec Act, showed the disparities in lawmaking between the English and French regions. An example of the role of English-French conflicts in Canadian law.

        A growing frustration with the monarchial government due to its poor handling of legislation and lack of reform lead to a series of violent, rebellious acts in both Upper and Lower Canada. The rebellion from the public lead to significant changes such as the 
        reformation of Upper and Lower Canada into a unified state with a sole responsible government [11]. This came into effect with the Act of Union in 1840, and eventually the British North American Act of 1867. Thus, its no secret that this event was crucial to the 
        development of Canada as a confederation.

        Enacted by the British Parliament, it united the colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada under one government [12]. Recommended by Lord Durham in his famous <i>Durham Report</i> (1839) after observing the Rebellion acts, a new parliament system was formed, which included 
        elected seats for both regions, and banishment of French institutions on civil law and French as an official language. These anti-French measures drew opposition from Lower Canada, and eventually were repealed. Because of the new responsible government, the public 
        was given right to negotiate provisions of the act rather than the Crown [12]. This can be interpreted as the earliest example of Canadian democracy.

      <p>
        This war was the result of the past four decades of modernization in the American colonies and conflicting values over exploitation through slavery [13]. The resulting expansion of west coast land due to the north's victory feared the people in Canada, 
        prompting government to commence the confederation of Canada. This was a crucial move to avoid a potential invasion that would have threatened the people and decades of progress towards a well-established legislature.

      <p>
        Arguably the most significant event in Canadian history and law. This was the culmination of the merger of the former two regions, the American Civil War, and centuries of development in lawmaking and governance. This act solidifed Canada as a true country, with a central governing body. 
        Provinces had more freedom with their own government and French became a recognized language. It established the basis of the Constitution, which would be further expanded upon 
        in the next century.

        Following confederation, the notions that were set by the framers of the Constitution would take six decades to be fully realized after the acts of 1867. 
        In particular, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC), a British court of appeal, was not in favor of the key ideas of a true central government and conservative politics. They were rooted 
        in liberalism and many of its practices were interpreted as favoring provincial governments. This can be viewed as the result of British culture interfering with Canadian culture, and there needed to
        be significant changes to the legislation that would allow Canada to stay true to its founding fathers.

        A landmark case for women's rights. This is an example of the JCPC utilizing their power over legislation for the advancement of gender equality in the Senate. The main impact of this case was the 
        dominance of a liberal judiciary approach to the Constitution, where present day society influences the law rather than old legal documents or events from the past.

        A huge turning point in Canadian Law, and a milestone in Canadian independence from Britain. Enacted by the British Parliament, it bestowed sovereign policy on legislation onto the goverment of Canada. 
        As a result, the Supreme Court would no longer require an appeal from the JCPC to enact any federal or provincial law. This also allowed Canada to minimize the influence of British politics into Canadian culture. An act that finally allowed 
        Canada to restore the notions set in the Constitution Act of 1867.

        This global recession period played a huge role in how Canada's federal government came to dominate all country affairs, both federal and provincial. To address the rising unemployment rates from the great depression, 
        the goverment established welfare state that provided insurance, pension, agriculture expansion, and social assistance. This helped the provinces that were either experiencing job shortages or drought conditions. 
        After all, the timing of the Statue of Westminster did not help Canada's recovery from the depression. The now soverign federal goverment had many legislative responsiblites to fulfill because of this.
