        This invasion was an attempt to take over the throne which was under King Edward and his successor Harold Godwinson. 
        William I, the Duke of Normandy and soon-to-be Conqueror, challenged candidates Harald III of Norway and Godwinson's brother Tostig by invading south England. 
        Through a series of battles, deadly military tactics, and threats from rebels, William I claimed victory [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        After the victory, William I established the ideas that would form feudalism, a prevailing form of government based on full ownership of land by a Lord (one of higher power). William assigned people as landowners, and landowners had a mutual obligation to provide military services.
        This system of government made legislation and social justice directly tied to a monarch, who was in charge of all lawmaking, implementation and interpretation of law.

      <p>
        The formation of the treaty occurred after the end of the Seven Years War (1756 - 1763), where Great Britain claimed victory over France, 
        and was now ruling over land that would form both Canada and the United States. It allowed legislative authority to be held under three parties: the governor, the governor's council, and the assembly. Although this came before the establishment of Canada as a country, 
        this treaty was responsible for the institutional relationship between the government and aboriginal groups that is still in effect today.

        Enacted by the British Parliament, this served to preserve the French Canadian population and revoke the assimilation attempts caused by the Royal Proclamation Treaty [3]. This event is seen as an act 
        of gaining the trust of French-spoken people and establish rights to property and religious freedom in Quebec. However, this was to the dismay of the American colonies, serving an important catalyst to the American Revolutionary War [3]. This event can be seen as one of the earliest forms of English-French peace relations in Canada, 
        and would influence many legislative decisions made in Quebec to preserve human rights and culture.

        A significant event of the American Revolution (1765 - 1791), this war contributed to the political independence of North American colonies that were held under Great Britain. The effects of the war were of great magnitude, 
      	resulting in establishment of the American Declaration of Independence, and a large amount of unfavorable settlers emigrating towards Canadian territory [5]. Those who emigrated were seen as British loyalists, and thus developed 
        a culture shaped around conservatism. This can be seen as the birth of Canadian culture, and an example of influence from Britain's parliamentary government that would form the nation to come.

      Synonymously known as the Canada Act of 1791, this was enacted by the Parliament of Britain to segregate the province of Quebec into two regions: Upper and Lower Canada. Key justifications of this act included access to equal rights, woman's right to vote, 
      and establishment of provincial legislation [10]. Upper Canada mainly used Common law, whereas Lower Canada used Old french law [10]. 
      This act, along with the Quebec Act, showed the disparities in lawmaking between the English and French regions. An example of the role of English-French conflicts in Canadian law.

      A growing frustration with the monarchial government due to its poor handling of legislation and lack of reform lead to a series of violent, rebellious acts in both Upper and Lower Canada. The rebellion from the public lead to significant changes such as the 
      reformation of Upper and Lower Canada into a unified state with a sole responsible government [11]. This came into effect with the Act of Union in 1840, and eventually the British North American Act of 1867. Thus, its no secret that this event was crucial to the 
      development of Canada as a federal state.

      <h4>Act of Union</h4>

    <li class="event">
      Enacted by the British Parliament, it united the colonies of Upper Canada and Lower Canada under one government [12]. Recommended by Lord Durham in his famous <i>Durham Report</i> (1839) after observing the Rebellion acts, a new parliament system was formed, which included 
      elected seats for both regions, and banishment of French institutions on civil law and French as an official language. These anti-French measures drew opposition from Lower Canada, and eventually were repealed. Because of the new responsible government, the public 
      was given right to negotiate provisions of the act rather than the Crown [12]. This can be interpreted as the earliest example of Canadian democracy.
