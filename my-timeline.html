        This invasion was an attempt to take over the throne which was under King Edward and his successor Harold Godwinson. 
        William I, the Duke of Normandy and soon-to-be Conqueror, challanged candidates Harald III of Norway and Godwinson's brother Tostig by invading south England. 
        Through a series of battles, deadly military tactics, and threats from rebels, William I claimed victory.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the victory, William I established the ideas that would form fedualism, a prevailing form of government based on full ownership of land by a Lord (one of higher power). William assigned people as landowners, and landowners had a mutual obligation to provide military services.
        This system of government made legislation and social justice directly tied to a monarch, who was in charge of all lawmaking, implementation and interpretation of law.

        The formation of the treaty occured after the end of the Seven Years War (1756 - 1763), where Great Britain claimed victory over France, 
        and was now ruling over land that would form both Canada and the United States. Altough this came before the establishment of Canada as a country, 
        this treaty was responsible for the insitutional relationship between the government and aborigional groups that is still in effect today.
